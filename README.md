In the last years, there is a growing number of physical objects that are being connected to the Internet at an unprecedented rate, realizing the idea of the Internet of Things (IoT).There are many different domains in which the IoT can play a remarkable role and improve the quality of our life. These applications include healthcare, transportation, industrial automation and smart home. We want to focus on the smart home domain. Our idea is Smile, a personal dj that manage music and lights in your room, according to your activity. Smile can know what you are doing since it is synchronized with your calendar and it checks if you are actually in the right room thanks to a infrared sensor and to a localization service. Smile has some predefined profiles for each activities, but the user can change them using a GUI. The most important aspects of a profile are color and intensity of lights and music. In order to get the music you like, Smile will connect with Spotify, using your playlists or your musical preferences.
